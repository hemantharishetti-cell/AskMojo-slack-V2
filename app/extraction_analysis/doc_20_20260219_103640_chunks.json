    "text": "Executive Summary\n\nThe rapid rise of short-form video platforms like Instagram and TikTok has transformed the way creators engage their audiences. For many, the process of transforming long talking-head content into engaging reels remains manual, time intensive, and inconsistent.\n\nMoolya proposes an AI-driven SaaS platform that automates this process end-to-end 4 from ingesting raw talking-head videos, analyzing stylistic references, transcribing speech, creating captions, inserting B-roll, and exporting optimized reels. The system is designed to align with user-defined style profiles, ensuring that each output reflects the creator\u2019s unique identity while maintaining professional consistency.\n\nThe solution will be developed as a cloud-native, scalable SaaS platform with GPU-accelerated processing pipelines, modular architecture, and role-based access for individuals and teams. The initial build will focus on an MVP that produces Instagram-ready reels, with optional enhancements in subsequent phases (e.g., adaptive style learning, real-time previews).",
