For many the process of transforming long talking-head content\ninto engaging reels remains manual time intensive and inconsistent. Moolya proposes an AI-driven\nSaaS platform that automates this process end-to-end from ingesting raw talking-head videos\nanalyzing stylistic references transcribing speech creating captions inserting B-roll and exporting\noptimized reels. The system is designed to align with user-defined style profiles ensuring each\noutput reflects the creator’s unique identity while maintaining professional consistency. The solution\nwill be developed as a cloud-native scalable SaaS platform with GPU-accelerated processing\npipelines modular architecture and role-based access. The initial build will focus on an MVP that\nproduces Instagram-ready reels with optional enhancements in later phases.",

For many the process of transforming long talking-head content\ninto engaging reels remains manual time intensive and inconsistent. Moolya proposes an AI-driven\nSaaS platform that automates this process end-to-end from ingesting raw talking-head videos\nanalyzing stylistic references transcribing speech creating captions inserting B-roll and exporting\noptimized reels. The system is designed to align with user-defined style profiles ensuring each\noutput reflects the creator’s unique identity while maintaining professional consistency. The solution\nwill be developed as a cloud-native scalable SaaS platform with GPU-accelerated processing\npipelines modular architecture and role-based access.
